# Storage Smart Contract

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bbcdaed6-62a7-4cfc-bff3-d69709733e0f)

## Vision

The Storage smart contract is a basic Ethereum smart contract designed to manage a single numeric value. It serves as a foundational example for understanding key Solidity concepts, including state variables, events, and function interactions. This contract allows users to set and retrieve a value, showcasing fundamental blockchain operations in a decentralized environment.

## Flowchart

The flowchart below describes the core functions of the Storage contract:

1. **Set Number**
   - User calls `setNumber` with a new numeric value.
   - The contract updates the stored value and emits a `NumberUpdated` event.

2. **Get Number**
   - User calls `getNumber`.
   - The contract returns the current stored value.

## Contract Address
0xd38c4819ce8e88e3b80795e4f4bdbbe4cef16b5e

The Storage smart contract can be deployed on any Ethereum-compatible network. Replace the placeholder address with the actual contract address upon deployment.

```
Contract Address: 0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678
```

## Future Scope

1. **Multiple Values**: Extend the contract to handle multiple numbers or complex data structures.
2. **Access Control**: Add permissions to restrict who can set the number.
3. **Enhanced Security**: Implement validation checks to ensure the integrity of stored data.
4. **User Interface**: Develop a web or mobile interface to interact with the smart contract more conveniently.
